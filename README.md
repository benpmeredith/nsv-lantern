## NoSchoolViolence.org

This repository currently contains very few EDA scripts used to understand our raw data, which are text documents. Some of the older scripts written for this project can be found in [the other repository](https://github.com/kalo37/Lantern_v2). This repository may be deprecated, due to collaborations with other corporations developing a new version of the app.

### Description
The Lantern® 2 is a Python web app search query tool providing users with the means of correlating observed behaviors to certain types of violence. This is achieved by:

1.	Developing a Natural Language Processing (NLP) model that can analyze academic research journals and extract values that relate behaviors with types of violence.
2.	Using databases that store the journal documents and extracted values.
3.	Using a search tool that accepts a query containing multiple observed behaviors, then compute a risk score that suggests the likelihood of committing different types of violence.
4.	Developing a web app/website with well-designed UX/UI where the users can use the search tool.
